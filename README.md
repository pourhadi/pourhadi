## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Pourhadi

### Some things you should know:
* Throughout high school and early college I contributed frequently to Macworld and MacAddict magazines and tech blogs like Engadget
* The first mobile app I built was in middle school for the Palm III
* I was sitting in the 7th row when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone for the first time at Macworld San Francisco
* I am an entirely self-taught programmer, having gone to school (briefly) for political science (until building apps took over my life)

I've pinned some of the good stuff. Feel free to look around and [contact me](mailto:dan@pourhadi.com) with any questions.
